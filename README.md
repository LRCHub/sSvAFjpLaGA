```lrc
[00:44.21] I must have sent four hundred poems
[00:47.45] On the way you used to smile at me
[00:51.70] I used to write 'em for you daily
[00:54.98] But my thumbs are running dry lately
[00:59.76] No one wants to hear a song
[01:03.28] About the bitch that broke my heart
[01:06.94] I should've listened to my mama
[01:10.79] She saw through you from the start
[01:27.79] 
[01:14.12] But now we're here in Regent's park
[01:17.25] Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
[01:21.66] 'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
[01:24.81] That I'm falling for you over again
[01:29.35] Since I have nothing left to say
[01:33.15] That will make you change your mind
[01:36.73] I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day
[01:57.73] 
[01:44.38] It was a place not too dissimilar to this one
[01:48.54] Where I first saw your face
[01:51.49] You look like home, sat all alone
[01:54.72] I should have found somebody cheaper to chase
[01:59.74] Tragically, nobody told me
[02:03.28] How expensive you would be
[02:07.35] I lost more than money, dear
[02:10.33] You knocked the swagger out of me
[02:26.83] 
[02:14.23] But now we're here in Regent's park
[02:17.28] Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
[02:21.65] 'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
[02:24.66] That I'm falling for you over again
[02:29.37] Since I have nothing left to say
[02:33.33] That will make you change your mind
[02:37.21] (Make you change your mind)
[02:42.31] I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day
