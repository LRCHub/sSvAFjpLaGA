I must have sent
four hundred poems
on the way
you used to smile at me
I used to write them for you
daily but my thumbs are
running dry lately
No one wants to hear a song
about the bitch
that broke my heart
I should've listened to my mama,
she saw through you
from the start
But now we're here in Regent's
Park amongst the flowers
And I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun,
you look so lovely that
I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
that will make you
change your mind
I'll say goodbye
on a beautiful spring day
There was a place not too
dissimilar to this one
where I first saw your face
You look like home,
sat all alone
I shoulda found somebody
cheaper to chase
Tragically, nobody told me
how expensive you could be
I lost more than money, dear,
you knocked the swagger
out of me
But now we're here in Regent's
Park amongst the flowers
And I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun,
you look so lovely that
I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
that will make you
change your mind
(Make you change your mind)
I'll say goodbye
on a beautiful spring day
